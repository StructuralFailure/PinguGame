=== Solid moving entity collision ===

Step 1) Update all solid moving entities first.
		While doing that, check for collisions with non-solid entities.
			If there are any, move them outside the solid entity
			by the same vector as the movement of the solid entity.
			Now there should be no more collisions.

Step 2) Now, in the normal update loop, entities can still call the move
		function to move while taking into account collision with solid cells.
		Somewhere in there, add checks for solid entities (maybe first)?

		This way, as far as the entities are concerned, the solid entities
		are no longer moving, therefore we can treat them similarly to solid cells.
		It also allows to return which side of the solid entity was collided with,
		so entities can use it to adjust their behavior accordingly,
		i.e. reset their vertical or horizontal speed.

Step 3) This should theoretically be all, but I'm sure there are some edge-cases
		that aren't covered and are going to make this not work.
