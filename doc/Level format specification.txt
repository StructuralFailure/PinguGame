=== Level file structure ===

A blank line signifies the beginning of a new section.

== Section 1 == Tile map ==

In this section, the level's tile map is specified. Starting at y = 0, 
every character represents the type of one tile. A new line increments
y by 1.

== Section 2 == Entities ==

Here, entities' data is stored. This includes their type and
all other data they might require for their creation in the world. All
entities specified in the file will be spawned as soon as world is loaded.

An entity can only be loaded from a level file if it implements a deserializer
function. The first digit in the line represents the type of the entity.
After it is read, the world loader will try to find the correct deserializer.
If it is found, the entire line is passed to it, and the entity can use it
to set its state accordingly.

	type datum_a, datum_b, datum_c, ...

If no deserializer is found, the entity is not created, an error message is
displayed, and the line is ignored.
