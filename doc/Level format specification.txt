=== Level file structure ===

A blank line signifies the beginning of a new section.

== Section 1 == Tile map ==

In this section, the level's tile map is specified. Starting at y = 0, 
every character represents the type of one tile. A new line increments
y by 1.

== Section 2 == Entity map ==

Here, entities' data is stored. This includes their type, their position,
and all other data they might require for their creation on the map. All
entities specified in the file will be spawned as soon as the level is loaded.

Unsure about the format, but it could be something like this:

	TYPE, X, Y, W, H, DATA

- X, Y, W, and H determine the values of Entity.rect.
  As entities know their width and height anyway, W and H may not
  be necessary.

- DATA may contain additional data required for initialization.
  What is not specified will be set to 0.
