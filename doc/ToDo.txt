=== To-Do List ===

(--- very important -- important - minor)

--- Fix segmentation fault upon going out of bounds (x+ tested)
    No idea where it occurs.

--- Implement a state machine.

--- Instead of using CM_CELL_WIDTH and CM_CELL_HEIGHT, add a field to
    the Game (or Level?) structure that determines the size of a cell.

-- Maybe not necessary with entity ownership: Add Entity <-> Entity communication in the form of events.

-- Add coins and animated

-- Add support for entities in level loader.

- Use proper types for sizes (size_t instead of int).

- Maybe rename Graphics.h to something more sensible.
