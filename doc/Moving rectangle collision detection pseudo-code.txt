How to detect if and where two rectangles collide when one of them is moving at a constant velocity.

M  := moving rectangle
Mc := center of moving rectangle

S  := stationary rectangle
Sc := center of stationary rectangle

V  := velocity of moving rectangle

D  := distance between moving and stationary rectangle

           Mw                Dw
ratio(M) = --    ratio(D) =  --
           Mh                Dh

top := ratio(M) > ratio(D)

if (top) {
    y = Mh / 2
    calculate x
} else {
    x = Mw / 2
    calculate y
}

distance(M + D*t, C) == CtoB
